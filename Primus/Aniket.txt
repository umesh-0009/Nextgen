Boost Your PC Like an IT Support Pro – CMD Commands You Should Know! 🖥️💡

Whether you’re a tech enthusiast or working in IT support, knowing a few Command Prompt (CMD) tricks can save you a ton of time and help troubleshoot everyday issues.

Here are some essential CMD commands I use regularly in IT support:

🛠️ Check and Fix Disk Errors
chkdsk C: /f /r
✅ Scans and repairs file system issues and bad sectors.

🧱 Repair System Files
sfc /scannow
✅ Scans and fixes corrupted Windows system files.

🧰 Restore Windows Health
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
✅ Repairs system image when things just don’t work right.

🧹 Clear Temp Files
del /q/f/s %TEMP%\*
✅ Frees up space and removes clutter.

⚡ See What’s Running
tasklist & taskkill /f /im appname.exe
✅ Check for resource hogs and close unresponsive apps.

🧼 Launch Disk Cleanup
cleanmgr
✅ Easy way to clear junk files without installing anything.

These basic commands help solve issues faster, improve system performance, and keep things running smoothly—even before calling for escalation. 💪
